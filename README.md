# lambdaway
The {lambda way} project is a workshop built as a thin overlay on top of any modern web browser, and devoted to writing, composing and coding on the web, where the markup, styling and scripting are unified in a single language, {lambda talk}.

    • Everything can be seen in http://lambdaway.free.fr/ ,
    • A complete 50kb archive can be downloaded from http://lambdaway.free.fr/workshop/archive.zip ,

This is how a minimal wiki can be built using the 5 files which have been uploaded in this submit:

    1) create a folder named for instance. "mywiki",
    2)  in "mywiki" put the files "index.php" and "config.php",
    3) in "mywiki" create five folders named "meca", "skins", "pages", "history" and "data"
    3.1) in "meca" put the files "HTML.html", "PHP.php" and "JS.js",
    3.2) in "skins" create a folder named "basic" and put the file "CSS.cs" in it,
    3.3) let empty the three other folders, "pages", "history" and "data",
    4) via FTP upload the folder "mywiki" to your web account (running PHP) and control files system permissions.

You can now access your wiki and begin to edit pages.
