# lambdaway
The {lambda way} project is a wiki, {lambda tank}, built as a thin overlay on top of any modern web browser, and devoted to writing, composing and coding on the web, where the markup, styling and scripting are unified in a single language, {lambda talk}.

Everything new can be seen in the {lambda way} project's wiki: http://lambdaway.free.fr/lambdaspeech/
